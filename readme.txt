Description:

Simple widget app containing 3 widgets of analog clock, calendar showing current date and weather widget showing temperature of Islamabad, Pakistan are added. 
Coding is done in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery. As the widget.html file is executed, user can see three widgets on the homescreen. There is an option to 
select and of the widget which is then shown bigger and at the center of the screen. This part is done in JQuery. Now when a particular widget is opened, user 
can get access to the main page aka Dashboard by just clicking on the "Go Back To Dashboard" option which reloads the page and all the widgets are visible again.
This part is also done in JQuery.
